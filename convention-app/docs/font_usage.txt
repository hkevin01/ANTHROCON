#### Using Fonts in Your Application

To use a custom font in a Kivy Label:

label = Label(text="Welcome to the Convention App", font_name='assets/fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf')
```

#### Using Icons in Buttons

```python
from kivy.uix.button import Button

class CustomButton(Button):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.background_normal = 'assets/icons/home_icon.png'
```
